# Compiler for Lang24

The creator and author of Lang24's language specification is doc. dr. Boštjan Slivnik (bostjan.slivnik@fri.uni-lj.si).

This compiler was made as part of Compiler lectures at University of Ljubljana Faculty of Computer and Information
Science.

The lectures are taught by doc. dr. Boštjan Slivnik. Parts of the compiler code are also authored by the professor.

## Compiler

Targets 64bit RISC-V architecture.

## Extension

The compiler also contains an extension for the RISC-V Vector extension. Vectorization is done with data dependence
analysis.

Analysis and generating vectorized intermediate code is implemented.

The extension was done as part of undergrad work under mentor Boštjan Slivnik bostjan.slivnik@fri.uni-lj.si.

All code for the vector extension was authored by me (marko.muc12@gmail.com).
